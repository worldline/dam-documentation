## Meet the DAM Platform

### Our Goal

We are building a future where value is transferred as easily and efficiently as information. Where what we call payment will also integrate any products that can be transformed into digital assets.

To do so we are focus on creating an <b>innovative, modular</b> and <b>future proof</b> platform; WL Digital Asset Management to be a key building block of <b>the future of PayTech</b>.

### 1. Create a secured operation network

DAM is a blockchain based solution, we implement a private blockchain for you and your trusted partners so you can manage digital assets transactions. 



#### DAM blockchain network
This operation network is secured by design and offer key business benefits like :

<b>Accurate tracking</b>,  all transaction are timestamped and recorded on the blockchain. For each transaction we can ensure that only the owner of the wallet did the transaction and we can trace back all the transactions done by this user. 

<b>Permanent data storage</b>, the DAM network is designed such that no one can change the blockchain, once the transaction blocks get added on the chain, no one can go back and change it. Thus, any user on the network won’t be able to edit, delete or update it past transactions. 

<b>Instantaneous Settlement</b>, on DAM because of the blockchain technology that we use, transactions are instantaneous and directly written on the blockchain. The settlement is done automatically ensuring that it's the right user that do a transaction, that he has what we want to send and the rights to do so. Also by design we ensure that there is no double spending that can happen on the platform. Since the network do this settlement for you you can ensure fast settlement time on your application with a high level of security. 

<b>Verifiable and Trustable</b>, using your own <u>private blockchain network</u> you will be able to create an ecosystem with your partners where you don't need to trust a third party but a system where at any point you can verify that nobody is cheating on the network. Reinventing trust between multiple parties. 



#### Issuance of digital assets
Using blockchain technology you can tokenize any type of real life assets. Using DAM you will have a solution allowing the digitization of multiple assets such as cash, ticketing, loyalty, vouchers; all in one modular end-to-end solution.

On DAM you will issue a digital asset when you want to represent something real in a digital way or create a purely digital element. Then regarding how fungible the asset is you can issue one of the following type.

Using this type of asset on DAM enable physical assets like cash or gold to be digitized and represented on the blockchain as a digital currency. But can also be used issue loyalty points, digital gifts cards or even take some stock option and make them more liquid using blockchain tokenization. 



<b>Non-Fungible Assets</b>

"<em>Assets that can not be interchanged with other of the same type. They're unique and special.</em>"

Using this type of asset on DAM enable physical assets like fine art or real estate to be digitized and represented on the blockchain as digital asset called NFT. But can also be used issue digital tickets or represent digital title of ownership.
